# Hello there

This is my blog spot for my final from CodeFellows.

In this github you'll see that there is an image to my whiteboard.. I didn't add to the white boad except what has been expressed.

the blog is, well... the blog. It's not quite 800 words, but it is nearly 2 pages on a size 11 font w/ consolas.

And the pathWeight.js is the final functioning code!

Cheers!
